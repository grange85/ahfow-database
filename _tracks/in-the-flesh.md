track-lyrics: "Darlin' darlin' darlin'\nI can't wait to see you\nYour picture ain't enough\nI can't wait to touch you in the flesh\nDarlin' darlin' darlin'\nI can't wait to hear you\nRemembering your love\nIs nothing without you in the flesh\n\nWent walking one day on the lower East side\nMet you with a girlfriend, you were so divine\nShe said, &quot;Hands off this one sweetie, this boy is mine.&quot;\nI couldn't resist you - I'm not deaf, dumb, and blind\n\nDarlin' darlin' darlin'\nNow you're out of town\nThose girls that you run with\nThey bring my head down\nOoh Darlin' darlin'\nWatch out if I see you\n'Cause if you say hello\nIt'll mean you wanna see me in the flesh\n\nOoh warm and soft, in the flesh\nOoh close and hot, in the flesh\nOoh"
