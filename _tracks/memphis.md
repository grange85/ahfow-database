"&quot;Memphis&quot; was actually written by actress Karen Black, for the\nRobert Altman film &quot;Nashville&quot;\n\nShe played a second-tier singer destined to serve as perpetual \nstand-in for emotionally fragile superstar Barbara Jean, another \nicon who is accidentally assassinated at a political rally at \nthe movie's end. \n\n&quot;Memphis&quot; was generally considered an egregiously bad song \nwritten by an amateur whose dislike for country music was evident \nfrom the song's sappiness. At the time it was generally thought \nthat Altman let it into the film as an indulgence to Karen Black.\n\n(Bill Jaynes)"
