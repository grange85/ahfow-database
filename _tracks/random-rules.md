track-lyrics: "In 1984 I was hospitalized for approaching perfection. \nSlowly screwing my way across Europe, they had to make a correction. \nBroken and smokin' where the infrared deer plunge in the digital snake. \nI tell you, they make it so you can't shake hands when they make your hands shake. \n\nI know you like to line dance, everything so democratic and cool, \nBut baby there's no guidance when random rules. \n\nI know that a lot of what I say has been lifted off of men's room walls. \nMaybe I've crossed the wrong rivers and walked down all the wrong halls. \nBut nothing can change the fact that we used to share a bed \nand that's why it scared me so when you turned to me and said: \n\n&quot;Yeah, you look like someone \nYeah you look like someone who up and left me low. \nBoy, you look like somene I used to know.&quot; \n\nI asked the painter why the roads are colored black. \nHe said, &quot;Steve, it's because people leave \nand no highway will bring them back.&quot; \nSo if you don't want me I promise not to linger, \nBut before I go I gotta ask you dear about the tan line on your ring finger. \n\nNo one should have two lives, \nnow you know my middle names are wrong and right. \nHoney we've got two lives to give tonight."
