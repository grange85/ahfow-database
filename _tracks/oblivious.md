track-lyrics: "Came to the door but she wouldn't see me\nSo I turned away to leave\nShe leaned out the window and said &quot;Where ya goin?&quot;\nNow I have no time to grieve\n\nAnd as I pushed my foot to the pedal\nI was driving much too fast\nRain comin down and I couldn't see much\nNow I have no time to grieve\n\nNow you're right all the time\nAnd I'm just oblivious\nI'd rather stay in bed with you\nTill it's time to get a drink"
