The A Head Full of Wishes database into Jekyll
=================================================

Just over a year ago I took the AHFoW database out of a custom built database/php site and squeezed it into Wordpress - a year on that was clearly a mistake, or I just got bored and wanted to put it somewhere else.

It's a big site (1000s of pages) so may be a challenge for Jekyll - but... you know, it keeps me off the streets.

You can see the work in progress here:

[A Head Full of Wishes database](http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/)

It's built with Jekyll and uses Bootstrap (and for now the default Boostrap theme)

The rest of A Head Full of Wishes (including the db in Wordpress) can be found over here:
