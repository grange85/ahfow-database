# The A Head Full of Wishes database into Jekyll


## Update 2021-02-11

This section and all it's content has now been migrated into the [main A Head Full of Wishes repo](https://github.com/grange85/ahfow-www/)


--- 

It's a big site (1000s of pages) so may be a challenge for Jekyll - but... you know, it keeps me off the streets.

You can see the work in progress here:

[A Head Full of Wishes database](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/)

It's built with Jekyll and uses Bootstrap (and for now the default Boostrap theme)

The rest of A Head Full of Wishes (including the db in Wordpress) can be found over here:
