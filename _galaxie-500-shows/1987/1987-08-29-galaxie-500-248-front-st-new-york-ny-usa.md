<p>Galaxie 500's first ever show.</p>

<blockquote>At summer's end we played a gig at my apartment on Front Street. Naomi made up little flyers for the event.It was the best gig of my life. I didn't break a string. I didn't forget the words. We played for 20 minutes, and it was just perfect.
<em>Dean Wareham - Black Postcards</em></blockquote>
